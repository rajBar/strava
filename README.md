# [raj.Bar/strava](https://raj.bar/strava)

This site is a page created to visualise how my strava runs have progressed over time. The project is written using react and also utilises google graphs for the visualisation.
For security reasons, I do not access the strava API directly from here, but instead I've written an API proxy to fetch the data from strava and return it to the site.

The site is deployed using the npm library "gh-pages"
